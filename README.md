# King Trivia Score Board

## A single-page web app for quizmasters to use during a King Trivia Game!

### NOTE: THIS IS FOR QUIZMASTERS (or developers who want to help me out) ONLY!!!

## Usage

for the time being, you must go to [this website](https://thegouge.github.io/king-trivia-score-card/) in order to use this score card. I'll be discussing with King Trivia to integrate it into their site for you. So look for that in the future!

In the meantime, let's go over the tabs within the app

### Score Board

when you first boot up the page, you'll be on the **Score Board** tab. This tab is basically a digital version of the typical King Trivia Score Sheet that Comes with your questions packet, as well as a few buttons that do stuff!

#### Add Team

this button adds a team line to the score board! This line

#### Reset

#### Download

### Current Round

### Standings
